Backend API for product catalog management with Clean Architecture.

## 🎯 **What's This?**

Product catalog system for clothing e-commerce. Manages products with variants (color/size), categories, and inventory.

## 💡 **Project Origin**

This project was inspired by a real business need - my mother recently opened a sleepwear and lingerie store. While I recommended established e-commerce platforms for speed and feature completeness, I decided to build this custom solution to validate technical concepts and explore Clean Architecture patterns with direct access to the stakeholder and end-user feedback.

The goal is creating a focused, maintainable codebase that could genuinely serve small fashion retailers while using modern .NET development practices.


## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- .NET 9 / C# 12
- Clean Architecture
- Entity Framework Core (planned)
- PostgreSQL (planned)

## 🚀 **Setup**

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```
