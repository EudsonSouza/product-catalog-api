# Development Roadmap

## Vision

Build a robust, well-tested backend that empowers small business owners to manage their inventory efficiently and prepare for production deployment.

## Current Status (Completed)

- Basic product and variant management
- PostgreSQL database with EF Core
- N-Layered Architecture structure
- Swagger API documentation
- Deployed to Render (development environment)

---

## Phase 1: Testing & Quality (Current Priority)

**Goal**: Establish comprehensive test coverage for reliability and maintainability

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Set up testing infrastructure (xUnit, FluentAssertions, Moq)
- [ ] Unit tests for Domain entities and business logic
- [ ] Unit tests for Services layer (ProductService, CategoryService, VariantService)
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests for database operations
- [ ] **Target**: >80% code coverage

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- [ ] Document testing strategies and patterns

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

---

## Phase 2: Complete CRUD Operations

**Goal**: Implement all Create, Read, Update, Delete operations with user-friendly workflows

### Product Management
- [ ] Create product with basic info (name, description, price, category)
- [ ] Update product details
- [ ] Delete product (soft delete for safety)
- [ ] List products with pagination, filtering, sorting
- [ ] Bulk operations (update prices, categories)

### Variant Management (Size, Color, Stock)
- [ ] **Easy variant form flow**:
  - Step 1: Basic product info
  - Step 2: Select available sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL, etc.)
  - Step 3: Select available colors
  - Step 4: Auto-generate variant combinations (e.g., Red-M, Blue-L)
  - Step 5: Set stock quantity for each variant
  - Step 6: Review and save
- [ ] Update variant stock levels
- [ ] Delete variants
- [ ] Bulk stock updates

### Category Management
- [ ] Create categories
- [ ] Update categories
- [ ] Delete categories (with product reassignment)
- [ ] Nested categories support

### Validation & Error Handling
- [ ] Input validation for all endpoints
- [ ] Meaningful error messages
- [ ] Prevent duplicate products/variants

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks

---

## Phase 3: Barcode Printing Functionality

**Goal**: Generate and print barcode labels for inventory management

### Barcode Generation
- [ ] Generate unique barcodes for products
- [ ] Generate barcodes for variants (size/color combinations)
- [ ] Support standard formats (Code128, EAN-13)
- [ ] Store barcode data in database

### Barcode Printing API
- [ ] Endpoint to generate barcode label PDF
- [ ] Customizable label templates (small, medium, large)
- [ ] Include product name, price, size, color on label
- [ ] Batch printing support (multiple labels at once)

### Integration
- [ ] Print preview functionality
- [ ] Download barcode labels as PDF
- [ ] Support for thermal label printers

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

---

## Phase 4: Production Deployment

**Goal**: Deploy stable, production-ready API with monitoring

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Security audit (authentication, authorization, input validation)
- [ ] Performance optimization (query optimization, caching)
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Environment configuration documented

### Deployment Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up production database (PostgreSQL on managed service)
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure CORS for production frontend
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging (Application Insights or similar)

### Production Features
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Structured logging
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting
- [ ] Database backup strategy
- [ ] API rate limiting

### Documentation
- [ ] Production deployment guide
- [ ] API documentation finalized
- [ ] User guide for business owner

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

---

## Phase 5: Future Enhancements

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] User authentication (JWT)
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Multi-user support (staff accounts)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Image upload and management
- [ ] Low stock alerts and notifications
- [ ] Sales tracking and analytics
- [ ] Export reports (inventory, sales)
- [ ] Inventory movement history

### Analytics & Insights
- [ ] Dashboard with key metrics
- [ ] Best-selling products
- [ ] Stock turnover analysis
- [ ] Profit margin calculations

### Integration
- [ ] WhatsApp Business API integration
- [ ] Payment gateway integration
- [ ] Accounting software integration
