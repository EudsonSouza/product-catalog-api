## Purpose

This Architecture Decision Log (ADL) captures important architectural and design decisions made throughout the project lifecycle. Each decision includes context, the decision made, and the rationale behind it.

## Format

Each architectural decision record (ADR) follows this structure:

-   **Decision**: What was decided
-   **Status**: Accepted, Proposed, Deprecated, or Superseded
-   **Context**: What factors influenced this decision
-   **Consequences**: Implications of this decision

## ADR-001: N-Layered Architecture Pattern

**Decision**: Adopt N-Layered Architecture with traditional layered structure (API, Services, Domain, Data)

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-01-15

**Context**:

-   Need for maintainable and testable codebase
-   Preference for simplicity over strict architectural rules
-   Team familiarity with traditional layered architectures
-   Portfolio project demonstrating professional practices
-   Small to medium-sized project scope

**Consequences**:

-   **Positive**: Clear separation of concerns, straightforward to understand
-   **Positive**: Business logic organized in Services and Domain layers
-   **Positive**: Simpler than Clean Architecture, easier to implement
-   **Positive**: Good balance between structure and flexibility
-   **Negative**: Less strict dependency rules than Clean Architecture
-   **Trade-off**: Services layer can depend on Data layer (more direct but less flexible)

## ADR-003: Repository Pattern with Unit of Work

**Decision**: Implement Repository Pattern with Unit of Work for data access

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-01-15

**Context**:

-   Need to abstract data access logic
-   Support for transaction management
-   Enable easier testing with mock repositories
-   Industry standard pattern for .NET applications

**Consequences**:

-   **Positive**: Abstracted data access logic
-   **Positive**: Easier to test business logic
-   **Positive**: Transaction support via Unit of Work
-   **Negative**: Additional abstraction layer
-   **Negative**: Some code duplication across repositories

## ADR-004: .NET 9 as Framework Version

**Decision**: Use .NET 9 as the target framework

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-01-15

**Context**:

-   Latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of .NET
-   Modern C# 12 language features
-   Performance improvements over previous versions
-   Long-term support and security updates
-   Portfolio project showcasing latest technology

**Consequences**:

-   **Positive**: Access to latest features and performance improvements
-   **Positive**: Long-term support and security updates
-   **Positive**: Modern language features (primary constructors, collection expressions)
-   **Negative**: Requires hosts to support .NET 9
-   **Trade-off**: Cutting edge vs stability (mitigated by LTS status)

## ADR-005: Swagger/OpenAPI for API Documentation

**Decision**: Use Swagger/OpenAPI for interactive API documentation

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-01-15

**Context**:

-   Need for comprehensive API documentation
-   Interactive testing capabilities desired
-   Industry standard for REST API documentation
-   Easy integration with ASP.NET Core

**Consequences**:

-   **Positive**: Interactive documentation and testing
-   **Positive**: Auto-generated from code annotations
-   **Positive**: Client SDK generation capability
-   **Positive**: Industry-standard OpenAPI specification
-   **Negative**: Requires maintaining XML documentation comments

---

## ADR-006: Product Variant Model

**Decision**: Implement product variants as separate entities with color/size combinations

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-01-15

**Context**:

-   Clothing retail requires size and color combinations
-   Each variant has independent stock quantity
-   Need to support variant-specific pricing in future
-   Real-world business requirement

**Consequences**:

-   **Positive**: Accurate representation of retail inventory
-   **Positive**: Independent stock tracking per variant
-   **Positive**: Supports future variant-specific pricing
-   **Negative**: More complex data model
-   **Negative**: More complex queries for product display

---

## ADR-007: RESTful API Design

**Decision**: Follow RESTful principles for API design

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-01-15

**Context**:

-   Industry standard for web APIs
-   Stateless communication model
-   Easy to understand and consume
-   Works well with HTTP caching

**Consequences**:

-   **Positive**: Predictable and intuitive API structure
-   **Positive**: Stateless and scalable
-   **Positive**: HTTP caching support
-   **Positive**: Wide client support
-   **Trade-off**: Some operations don't map cleanly to REST

## ADR-008: xUnit for Testing

**Decision**: Use xUnit as the testing framework

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-01-15

**Context**:

-   Modern, extensible testing framework
-   Recommended by Microsoft for .NET projects
-   Better isolation between tests
-   Supports async testing well

**Consequences**:

-   **Positive**: Modern testing framework with good tooling
-   **Positive**: Excellent async/await support
-   **Positive**: Test isolation via separate class instances
-   **Neutral**: Different from MSTest, learning curve for some
